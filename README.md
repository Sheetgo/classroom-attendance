# Grade and Attendance tracking Template 
### How the teachers and staffs will benefit on using this template?

After listening to our thousands education users that already benefits from using Sheetgo to automate and customize their student results tracking, we notice a barrier from those how uses Google Classroom on integrating this data with their spreadsheet to automate data flow.

As the administrative works cost can reach about 10-15h per week, at Sheetgo we decided support educators solving this challenge.

This template is structure to have a 30 min set up time per Teacher at the begin of the scholar year. During the year, all reports are going to be created automatically, while the teacher will only focus on assigning the grades at Google classroom and attendance on a single spreadsheet for all their classes that is possible to do using a mobile device.

Saving at least two hours per week of manual work per teacher.

# Understand the template structure
### There are 3 steps to set up your template that is specific for each Teacher:

  

1.  Grades: it will be exported automatically from Google Classroom to a spreadsheet, pulling the information of the students and test the made from all classes the teacher have active in his Classroom account
    
2.  Attendance: after following steps below, you will create a spreadsheet based on our template for inputting absence status.
    
3.  Dashboard: it will cross the information of attendance and grade to generate final report about classes and student scholar results.
